## ML algorithm used
Logistic Regression is a classification model mainly used for Binary classification of the Target Variable. It's use cases arises when the outcome is in the fomr of 'Yes'/'No' or 0/1, ie. when the Target variable is a categorical variable itself. 

It uses Sigmoid fucntion which converts that maps any input between 0 or 1. 

Linear regression method cannot be used for classification because outliers can affect the regression coefficients. That's why Logistic Regression is used, as the sigmoid fucntion transforms the best fitting line into to a S-type curve.
